#Project Question

Project Question: 
Can we predict the type of crime that will occur in a given neighborhood in DC depending on
the day, time, and time of year? 

Why I chose this question:
While crime rates in DC are at an all-time low in the past 20 years, DC still struggles with
relatively high crime rates like most major US cities.  I'm interested in putting more public 
data in the hands of everyday citizens so they can be more informed about the communities 
in which they live.  

What I know about the data so far:

What data sources I plan to use:
I plan to use the list of crime incidents for 2015 from DC's Open data portal, along with a few 
supplmentary sources to see if there is some other correlation/relationship, such as 
historical weather data for all of 2014.  

Data sources:
- District of Columbia Crime Incidents data for 2014

- Historical weather data for all of 2014
