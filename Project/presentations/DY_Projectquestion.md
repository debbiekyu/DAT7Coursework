#Project Question

*Project Question*   
Can we predict the type of crime that will occur in a given neighborhood in DC depending on
the day, time, and time of year? 

*Why I chose this question*  
While crime rates in DC are at an all-time low in the past 20 years, DC still struggles with
relatively high crime rates like most major US cities.  Crime is an unavoidable topic of 
conversation when it comes to living in DC, whether the crimes are theft, robbery, etc. DC is building
a great open data portal and I'm extremely interested in bringing insights about public data 
for ordinary citizens so they can have have a better gauge on public safety wherever they are
depending on where they are, and understand the power of open data.  
 

*What I know about the data so far*  
The list of crime incidents for 2014 looks pretty complete, with over 38k entries, MOST of which are complete.    
Most of the fields are fairly self-explanatory, one field is called "neighborhood cluster",
which is a grouping of 3-5 neighborhoods used by DC government for statistical purposes
(e.g. Cluster 2 is Columbia Heights, Mt. Pleasant, Pleasant Plains, and Park View). I think my  
biggest challenge will be figuring out the right geographic size by which I can make an accurate 
prediction - I may need to use groupings of block coordinates.  Other fields that are relevant/interesting 
are reported date/time, type of offense, method of offense, block site address, block xcoord and ycoord, ward, and census tract. 
Weather and census data is readily available but I do want to check a couple other outlets for real estate.
